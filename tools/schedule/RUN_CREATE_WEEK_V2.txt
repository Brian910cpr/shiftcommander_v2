YOU HIT A SCHEMA COLLISION.

Your DB already has a table named schedule_weeks, but with different columns.
So this v2 script writes to new namespaced tables:

- sc_weeks
- sc_shifts
- sc_shift_config
- sc_seat_records

This avoids breaking anything in your existing DB.

Run:

python .\create_week_v2.py --db "D:\Users\ten77\Downloads\shiftcommander_sync\ShiftCommander\live\shiftcommander.db" --start 2025-12-25 --first-out AMB121

Expected:
Week created (v2).
week_id: WEEK_2025-12-25_to_2025-12-31
